Simply put, zol (& fai) are tools to zoom in on a locus and perform comparative genomics (uh genetics) between homologous instances of gene clusters (not just BGCs, but phages and ICEs too!). **The main result from zol is a tabular report showcasing annotation info, conservation, and evolutionary stats for inferred ortholog groups amongst an input set of gene clusters.**

## Program Description 

### Prepate Target Genomes (prepTG)

**prepTG** processes and performs gene-calling or gene-mapping on an input set of genomes to ease and optimize downstream searches using fai.

### Find Additional Instances (fai)

**`fai`** is a program to search for additional instances of a gene-cluster or genome locus in some set of genomes. Inspired by cblaster, CORASON, ClusterFinder, MultiGeneBlast, etc. It leverages DIAMOND alignment similar to [cblaster](https://github.com/gamcil/cblaster) and runs fairly rapidly (allowing it to scale to thousands of genomes and even work on metagenomic assemblies). fai features some key differentiating options relative to other software: (i) can assess syntenic similarity of candidate homologous gene clusters to the query gene cluster, (ii) can allow for looser criteria thresholds for gene cluster detection in target genomes if multiple neighborhoods are identified as homologous and on scaffold edges (thus improving fragmented gene cluster identification due to assembly issues) - similar to lsaBGC-Expansion, (iii) filter secondary neighborhoods - e.g. homologous gene neighborhoods to the query which meet the criteria but are not the best match.

### Zoom on Locus (zol)

**`zol`** is a program to create table reports showing ortholog group conservation, annotation, and evolutionary stats for any gene-cluster or locus of interest. At it's core it performs ortholog group inference de novo across gene-cluster instances similar to [CORASON](https://github.com/nselem/corason), but uses an InParanoid-like algorithm. Tables are similar but currently more in-depth and feature some different statistics than lsaBGC-PopGene reports. zol produces a basic heatmap, but for visualizations of gene-clusters we recommend other tools such as [clinker](https://github.com/gamcil/clinker), [CORASON](https://github.com/nselem/corason), and [gggenomes](https://github.com/thackl/gggenomes), which we think the in-depth spreadsheet complements nicely. We also provide examples of how zol and skani can be used to select representative gene clusters for such visual investigations. 


Critically, ***with the development of some key options, together, fai and zol enable high-throughput detection of orthologs across multi-species datasets comprising of thousands of genomes.***

## Installation:

#### Bioconda (Recommended):

Note, (for some setups at least) ***it is critical to specify the conda-forge channel before the bioconda channel to properly configure priority and lead to a successful installation.***
 
**Recommended**: For a significantly faster installation process, use `mamba` in place of `conda` in the below commands, by installing `mamba` in your base conda environment.

```bash
# 1. install and activate zol
conda create -n zol_env -c conda-forge -c bioconda zol
conda activate zol_env

# 2. depending on internet speed, this can take 20-30 minutes
# end product will be ~29 GB! You can also run in minimal mode
# (which will only download PGAP HMM models < 5 GB) using -m.
setup_annotation_dbs.py
```

#### Docker:

___Requires docker to be installed on your system!___

To keep the Docker image size relatively low (currently ~8GB), only the PGAP database is included.

```bash
# get wrapper script from GitHub
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kalan-Lab/zol/main/docker/run_ZOL.sh

# change permissions to allow execution
chmod a+x ./run_ZOL.sh

# run script
./run_ZOL.sh
```

#### Conda Manual:

```bash
# 1. clone Git repo and change directories into it!
git clone https://github.com/Kalan-Lab/zol
cd zol/

# 2. create conda environment using yaml file and activate it!
conda env create -f zol_env.yml -n zol_env
conda activate zol_env

# 3. complete python installation with the following commands:
python setup.py install
pip install -e .

# 4. depending on internet speed, this can take 20-30 minutes
# end product will be 28 GB! You can also run in minimal mode
# (which will only download PGAP HMM models < 5 GB) using -m.
# within zol Git repo with conda environment activated, run:
setup_annotation_dbs.py
```

## Test case:

Following installation, you can run a provided test case focused on a subset of Enterococcal polysaccharide antigen instances in *E. faecalis* and *E. faecium* as such:

#### Bioconda:

```bash
# download test data tar.gz and bash script for running tests
wget https://github.com/Kalan-Lab/zol/raw/main/test_case.tar.gz
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kalan-Lab/zol/main/run_tests.sh

# run bash-based testing script
bash run_tests.sh
```

#### Docker:

```bash
# download test scripts from (bash script which you can reference for learning how to run zol).
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kalan-Lab/zol/main/docker/test_docker.sh

# change permissions to allow execution
chmod a+x ./test_docker.sh

# run tests
./test_docker.sh
```

Note, the script `test_docker.sh` must be run in the same folder as run_ZOL.sh!

#### Conda Manual:

Within the zol GitHub repo, run the following:

```bash
bash run_tests.sh
```
