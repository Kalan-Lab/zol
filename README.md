# *zol (& fai)*

Simply put, zol (& fai) are tools to zoom in on a locus and perform comparative genomics (uh genetics) between homologous instances of gene clusters (not just BGCs, but phages and ICEs too!). The main result from zol is a tabular report showcasing annotation info, conservation, and evolutionary stats for inferred ortholog groups amongst an input set of gene clusters.

zol produces a basic heatmap, but for visualizations of gene-clusters we recommend other tools such as [clinker](https://github.com/gamcil/clinker), [CORASON](https://github.com/nselem/corason), and [gggenomes](https://github.com/thackl/gggenomes), which we think the in-depth spreadsheet complements nicely.

### Zoom on Locus (zol) and Find Additional Instances (fai)

**`zol`** is a program to create table reports showing homolog group conservation, annotation, and evolutionary stats for any gene-cluster or locus of interest. At it's core it performs ortholog group inference de novo across gene-cluster instances similar to [CORASON](https://github.com/nselem/corason), but uses an InParanoid-like algorithm. Tables are similar but currently more in-depth and feature some different statistics than lsaBGC-PopGene reports.

**`fai`** is a program to search for additional instances of a gene-cluster or genome locus in some set of genomes. Inspired by cblaster, CORASON, ClusterFinder, MultiGeneBlast, etc. It leverages DIAMOND alignment similar to [cblaster](https://github.com/gamcil/cblaster) and runs fairly rapidly (allowing it to scale to thousands of genomes and even work on metagenomic assemblies). fai features some key differentiating options relative to other software: (i) can assess syntenic similarity of candidate homologous gene clusters to the query gene cluster, (ii) can allow for looser criteria thresholds for gene cluster detection in target genomes if multiple neighborhoods are identified as homologous and on scaffold edges (thus improving fragmented gene cluster identification due to assembly issues) - similar to lsaBGC-Expansion, (iii) filter secondary neighborhoods - e.g. homologous gene neighborhoods to the query which meet the criteria but are not the best match.

Critically, ***with the development of some key options, together, fai and zol enable high-throughput detection of orthologs across multi-species datasets comprising of thousands of genomes.***

### Installation:

```bash
# 1. clone Git repo and cd into it!
git clone https://github.com/Kalan-Lab/zol
cd zol/

# 2. create conda environment using yaml file and activate it!
conda env create -f zol_env.yml -p /path/to/zol_conda_env/
conda activate /path/to/zol_conda_env/

# 3. complete python installation with the following commands:
python setup.py install
pip install -e .

# 4. depending on internet speed, this can take 20-30 minutes
# end product will be 28 GB! but can also run in minimal mode
# (which will only download PGAP HMM models < 5 GB) using -m.
# within zol Git repo with conda environment activated, run:
setup_annotation_dbs.py
```

### Test case:

Following installation, you can run a provided test case focused on a subset of Enterococcal polysaccharide antigen instances in *E. faecalis* and *E. faecium* as such:

```bash
bash run_tests.sh
```

### Usage:

### prepTG (preparing to run fai)

prepTG formats and parses information in provided GenBank files or can run prodigal (for bacteria only!) for gene-calling if provided FASTA files and subsequently create GenBank files.

```bash
prepTG -i Folder_with_Target_Genomes/ -o prepTG_DB/
```

For additoinal details on prepTG (e.g. how to download genomes from NCBI), please check out the [1. more info on prepTG](https://github.com/Kalan-Lab/zol/wiki/1.-more-info-on-prepTG) wiki page.

### fai (finding homologous instances)

fai uses either (or combination) of a simple "gene-clumping" or "HMM-based" approach to identify homologous instances of a gene-cluster or known set of homologous gene-clusters:

1. Provide GenBank(s) of known instance(s) of gene cluster in an input directory

```bash
fai -i Known_GeneCluster_Genbanks/ -tg prepTG_Database/ -o fai_Results/
```

2. Provide gene-cluster coordinates along a FASTA reference genome 

```bash
fai -r Reference.fasta -rc scaffold01 -rs 40201 -re 45043 -tg prepTG_Database/ -o fai_Results/
```

3. Provide proteins gene-cluster using set of proteins that should be co-clustered (similar to cblaster!)

```bash
fai -pq Gene-Cluster_Query_Proteins.faa -tg prepTG_Database/ -o fai_Results/
```
For additional details on fai (e.g. how it relates to cblaster and lsaBGC-Expansion, plots it can create to assess homologous gene-clusters detected), please check out the [2. more info on fai](https://github.com/Kalan-Lab/zol/wiki/2.-more-info-on-fai) wiki page.

### zol (generating table reports)

```bash
zol.py -i Genbanks_Directory/ -o zol_Results/
```

zol produces an xlsx spreadsheet report where rows correspond to each individual ortholog group/homolog-group and columns provide basic stats, consensus order, annotation information using multiple databases, and evolutionary/selection-inference statistics. Coloring is automatically applied on select quantitative field for users to more easily assess trends.

Annotation databases include: KEGG, NCBI's PGAP, PaperBLAST, VOGs (phage related genes), MI-BiG (genes from characterized BGCs), VFDB (virulence factors), CARD (antibiotic resistance), ISfinder (transposons/insertion-sequences).

For details on the stats/annotations zol infers, please refer to the [zol](https://github.com/Kalan-Lab/zol/wiki/3.-more-info-on-zol/) wiki page.

## Updates  

### Minor Update - 05/05/2023

- update parsing of PGAP HMMs directory after extracting with tar.

### Version 1.2/1.02

- prepTG sample to GenBank relations now specified locally so creation of database is not locked into one location.
- Individual pickle files produced by prepTG per genome/metagenome for lower memory use with fai.
- New "Gene-Clumper" mode for gene-cluster discovery in fai, which is now the default.
- Fixed bug pertaining to overlap between merged gene-clusters based on `--max_gene_disconnect` parameter when using "HMM" mode.
- Improved filtering and retention of GenBanks in zol.
- Fixed bug in re-inflation method in zol.

### Version 1.1/1.01

- Remove unused individual proteome files in prepTG database directory.
- Store only gene-location information for scaffolds with hits by query proteins in fai to keep memory use low.
- Introduce parallelization to HMM step of fai and use global variables to access common data without duplicating in memory.
- Improve parsing of different input formats for fai and generate new PDF at end mapping individual protein names to non-redundantified protein queries.
- Declare "< 3 segrating sites found" as reason for inability to calculate Tajima's D instead of just "NA", which could also arise from not enough sequences or the sequence length threshold being met.
