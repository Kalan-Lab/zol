		Program: ZOL
		Author: Rauf Salamzade
		Affiliation: Kalan Lab, UW Madison, Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology
	
		Wrapper for running 3 main programs of the zol suite within Docker:
		
		- prepTG: prepare/setup a database directory of target genomes to search against using fai.
		- fai: perform targeted detection of query gene cluster(s) in genome database.
		- zol: create a tabular report profiling conservation, evo stats, and annotation for ortholog groups found 
			   across homologous/orthologous gene-cluster instance.
		
		Usage examples:
		
		prepTG -i Genomes/ -o prepTG_DB/ -c 10
		fai -pq query_proteins.faa -tg prepTG_DB/ -o fai_Results/ -c 10
		zol -i fai_Results/Homologous_GenBanks_Directory/ -o zol_Results/
