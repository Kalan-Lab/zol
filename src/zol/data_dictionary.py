Ortholog Group (OG) ID\tThe identifier of the ortholog/homolog group.\t\t
OG is Single Copy?\tWhether the ortholog/homolog group is single copy in the context of the gene-cluster.\tEvolutionary statistics should be evaluated carefully if False or multiple gene-clusters are from the same genome.
Proportion of Total Gene Clusters with OG\tThe proportion of input gene-clusters/GenBanks which feature the homolog group.\t\t
OG Median Length (bp)\tThe median length of the homolog group in basepairs.\t\t
OG Consensus Order\tThe consensus order of the homolog group across all gene clusters.\t\t
OG Consensus Direction\tThe consensus direction of the homolog group across all gene clusters.\t\t

Fixation Index\tFst estimate based on measuring pairwise differences in codon alignments and the statistic developed by Hudson, Slatkin, and Maddison 1992: https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/132/2/583/6009124?login=true\tOnly produced if comparative analysis is requested by user.

Tajima's D\tTajima's D calculated using implementation described in lsaBGC based on statistic developed by Tajima 1989: https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/123/3/585/5998755?login=true\tInterpret with care and consideration of divergence of genomes from which gene clusters were extracted. Calculation of statistic modified to account for the presence of gaps in alignments. Filtering of codon alignments in zol is currently different than what is applied in lsaBGC.
Proportion of Filtered Codon Alignment is Segregating Sites\tProportion of sites in filtered codon alignment which correspond to segregating sites.\tNote, segregating sites require two different non-gap alleles - gaps are not counted as a distinct allele.
Entropy\tAverage entropy over largely non-ambiguous sites (<10% ambiguity) in codon alignments.\t\t
Upstream Region Entropy\tAverage entropy over largely non-ambiguous sites (<10% ambiguity) in nucleotide alignments of upstream regions.\t\t
Median Beta-RD-gc\tThe median Beta-RD statistic for ortholog group relative to the full gene-cluster.\tCalculation is similar to what was described in the lsaBGC study, but expected divergence for ortholog group sequence between pair of gene-clusters/samples is not based on genome-wide divergence but gene-cluster divergence.
Max Beta-RD-gc\tThe max Beta-RD statistic observed for the ortholog group between two gene-clusters.\t\t
Proportion of sites which are highly ambiguous in codon alignment\tThe proportion of sites which are ambiguous (e.g. feature gaps) in greater than 10% of the sequences of a codon alignments (before trimming/filtering).\t\t
Proportion of sites which are highly ambiguous in trimmed codon alignment\tThe proportion of sites which are ambiguous (e.g. feature gaps) in greater than 10% of the sequences of trimmed codon alignments (via trimal).\t\t
Median GC\tThe median GC% of genes belonging to the ortholog group.\t\t
Median GC Skew\tThe median GC skew (G-C)/(G+C) of genes belonging to the ortholog group.\t\t
